AI and Vision
Machine learning (the most widely used subset of AI) promises to bring significant changes to both image recognition and language processing. These two innovations are driving many of the AI applications that are being used today. This seminar will explore the topic of image recognition. You will develop a basic understanding of how neural networks work, experiment with current image recognition technology and develop a presentation on how image recognition will be used in a specific application. The applications are diverse and you may choose to discuss ones that range from agriculture, to medicine and travel or even protecting coral reefs.
In the workshop, we'll create a presentation on the benefits and limitations of an application of AI that uses image recognition. This presentation will be informed by your own experience working with state of the art image recognition program.
Lead Facilitators: Kyle Barriger, AI Educator; Elaine Park, Bourn Idea Lab Director
